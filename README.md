R scripts for treeClust benchmarking manuscript

This is a brief explanation of the R scripts used for the benchmarking of the treeClust algorithm. This work is documented in more detail in our manuscript (ADD bioRxiv LINK HERE). The treeClust algorithm was developed by Buttrey & Whitaker ("treeClust: an R package for tree-based clustering dissimilarities", The R Journal, 2015).

# treeClust_bench_relationship_types.R
This script compares treeClust and correlation measures for their ability to detect non-linear relationships. It produces figure 1 of the manuscript.
